READMEShort (2 ms) subthreshold current pulses of varying amplitude and polarity were injected via whole-cell somatic current injection in cell 0603_cell08 (Eyal et al Fig. 1a) . Brief current pulses were used in order to minimize the activation of voltage-dependent mechanisms. Each stimulus was repeated 50 times and the voltage response was averaged (Fig. 1, black traces). These experimental voltage transients were used as a target for fitting theoretical transients generated by a model of that same 3D reconstructed cell (color traces in Fig. 1a, c). Optimization of cable parameters (specific membrane resistivity, Rm, and capacitance, Cm, and specific cytoplasm resistivity, Ra) was first performed by fitting model transients to the experimental voltage transient for 200 pA depolarization. The resultant model was then validated on different (depolarizing and hyperpolarizing) stimuli (Fig. 1b). Throughout, recorded membrane potential was corrected for calculated liquid junction potential of 16 mV.
