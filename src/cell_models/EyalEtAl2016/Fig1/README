In Figure 1, a brief depolarizing current pulse was injected to the
soma of the 3D-reconstructed HL2/3 PCs (Their reconstructions are
available in the morphs directory); the average resultant experimental
voltage transients are available in the Voltage_traces folders.

Detailed compartmental models for that same cells were then
constructed, including dendritic spines that were globally
incorporated into the model (Rapp et al. 1992). The shape, size,
membrane area, and distribution of dendritic spines in the HL2/3 model
were based on high-resolution 3D confocal images of several stretches
of HL2/3 PCs dendrites (Benavides-Piccione et al. 2013) (see Methods).

Attempts to fit the experimental transient (of one of these cells) via
the model are illustrated in Figure 1a (each with its corresponding
values for axial resistivity, Ra, specific membrane resistivity, Rm,
and capacitance, Cm). Only when Cm was surprisingly low ~ about 0.5
uF/cm2 we found a good fit.

This was also the case for the five other cells as demonstrated in Figure1cd
