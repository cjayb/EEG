In this figure we explored the impact of Cm ~ 0.5 Î¼F/cm2 on the spike
propagation velocity along the axon.
Two cases are tested - Model with Cm value of 0.45 uF/cm2 and model
with cm of 0.9 uF/cm2. More details about the models can be found in
Eyal et al.

We examined the case of a long non-myelinated axon, as the properties
of the myelin are not available yet for human neurons. As expected, a
lower Cm value increased the propagation speed of the action
potential; for the parameters we have used the propagation was about
65% faster compared with the case of a higher Cm
