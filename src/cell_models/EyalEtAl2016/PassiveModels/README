READMEIn this folder you’ll find the six detailed compartmental models from Figure 1 in Eyal et al.The cable parameters (axial resistivity, Ra, specific membrane resistivity, Rm, and capacitance, Cm) in all models are a result of optimization between an experimental voltage transient and the theoretical transient (the model response) . More details are available in Folder Figure 1.It’s important to note that in all models we globally incorporated their spines into their membrane assuming the Factor F = 1.9 (see Methods section for details).Contact: guy.eyal@mail.huji.ac.il
