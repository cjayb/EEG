Data as recorded by Thijs Verhoog and colabs in the Mansvelder lab.
At least ten repetitions of a step current injection were recorded in the six HL2/L3 cells. 
The voltage traces are avaiable as txtfile where the first number defines the input amplitude in pA

Another set of data was IF cruves from 25 other HL2/L3 PCs (see Deitcher et al 2017) and can be found as matlab data files in the folder IF_data
