The code here were used to create Figure8 and FigureS6 in Eyal et al 2017.
For creating Figure 8 the six human models were used and many cases were tested (Require long run on large cluster)
However a shorter version can be ran on a PC (Figure8A_shorter_version)
The full figure was generated by running a script similar to Figure8A_shorter_version.py for the six human models and one rat model for the different cases, see Methods in Eyal et al 2017.
