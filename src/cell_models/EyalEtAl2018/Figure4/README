In Figure 4 we modeled NMDA conductance by fitting experimental traces recorded in cell1303_05 with and without AMPA blockers.
The procedure can be found in the Methods section of Eyal et al. 2017. 
The best 100 models resulted from this optimization are described in “best_100_models.txt” or in best_100_models.p (pickle file). 
Fig4.py re-create figure 4 with the model we used in this paper, but the figure can be created with any one of the models by changing its index. 
The data in the data folder was recorded by Thijs Verhoog. 

To see an analysis of all the 100 models, see the code in FigS3. 
The model we used for the paper was also successful in fitting the five other data traces, see the code in FigS4
